RabbitMQ Tutorial Sample Application

This application implements the class RabbitMQ tutorials in Spring AMQP.  It is a
CLI app that uses Spring Profiles to control its behavior.

Sample usage:
java -jar rabbitmq-tutorials.jar --spring.profiles.active=tut1,sender
or
java -jar rabbitmq-tutorials.jar --spring.profiles.active=tut2,receiver

The following tutorials are available:

tut1,{sender|receiver}   Hello World
tut2,{sender|receiver}   Work Queues
tut3,{sender|receiver}   Work Queues
tut4,{sender|receiver}   Work Queues
tut5,{sender|receiver}   Work Queues
tut6,{client|server}   Work Queues

(The order of the profiles is not relevant.)

Remote Hosts:

To use to a remote RabbitMQ installation set the following properties as in this sample:

spring.rabbitmq.host=your-rabbit-server
spring.rabbitmq.username=tutorial-user
spring.rabbitmq.password=tutorial-password

To use this at runtime create a file called application-remote.yml (or properties) and set the properties in there.  Then use the 
remote profile.  See the Spring Boot and Spring AMQP documentation for more information on setting application 
properties and AMQP properties specifically.
